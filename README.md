##### [Docs](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/README.md) | [API reference](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md)

Playwright is a Python library to automate [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

|          | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|   :---   | :---: | :---: | :---:   |
| Chromium <!-- GEN:chromium-version -->86.0.4217.0<!-- GEN:stop --> | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| WebKit 14.0 | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |
| Firefox <!-- GEN:firefox-version -->78.0b5<!-- GEN:stop --> | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |

Headless execution is supported for all the browsers on all platforms.

## Installation

```
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
```

This installs Playwright and browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Once installed, you can `import` Playwright in a Python script and automate web browser interactions.

* [Getting started](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/intro.md)
* [Installation configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
* [API reference](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md)

## Capabilities

Playwright is built to automate the broad and growing set of web browser capabilities used by Single Page Apps and Progressive Web Apps.

* Scenarios that span multiple page, domains and iframes
* Auto-wait for elements to be ready before executing actions (like click, fill)
* Intercept network activity for stubbing and mocking network requests
* Emulate mobile devices, geolocation, permissions
* Support for web components via shadow-piercing selectors
* Native input events for mouse and keyboard
* Upload and download files

## Usage

### Pytest

For writing end-to-end tests we recommend to use the official [Pytest plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest#readme) for Playwright. It contains utilities for running it on multiple browsers, having a new page instance on every test or base-url support via a command-line argument. This will in the end look like that:

```py
def test_playwright_is_visible_on_google(page):
    page.goto("https://www.google.com")
    page.type("input[name=q]", "Playwright GitHub")
    page.click("input[type=submit]")
    page.waitForSelector("text=microsoft/Playwright")
```

For more information checkout the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest#readme).

### Standalone

For using Playwright standalone, you can either use the sync version or the async variant (async/await). In most cases the sync variant is the right choice to automate the web browsers e.g. for writing end-to-end tests. Both will get initialized with a context manager.

#### Sync variant

```py
from playwright import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    for browser_type in [p.chromium, p.firefox, p.webkit]:
        browser = browser_type.launch()
        page = browser.newPage()
        page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/')
        page.screenshot(path=f'example-{browser_type.name}.png')
        browser.close()
```

#### Async variant

```py
import asyncio
from playwright import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.webkit.launch()
        page = await browser.newPage()
        await page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/')
        await page.screenshot(path=f'example-{browser_type.name}.png')
        await browser.close()

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Examples

#### Page screenshot

This code snippet navigates to whatsmyuseragent.org in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, and saves 3 screenshots.

```py
from playwright import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    for browser_type in [p.chromium, p.firefox, p.webkit]:
        browser = browser_type.launch()
        page = browser.newPage()
        page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/')
        page.screenshot(path=f'example-{browser_type.name}.png')
        browser.close()
```

#### Mobile and geolocation

This snippet emulates Mobile Safari on a device at a given geolocation, navigates to maps.google.com, performs action and takes a screenshot.

```py
from playwright import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    iphone_11 = p.devices['iPhone 11 Pro']
    browser = p.webkit.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.newContext(
        **iphone_11,
        locale='en-US',
        geolocation={ 'longitude': 12.492507, 'latitude': 41.889938 },
        permissions=['geolocation']
    )
    page = context.newPage()
    page.goto('https://maps.google.com')
    page.click('text="Your location"')
    page.waitForRequest('*preview/pwa')
    page.screenshot(path='colosseum-iphone.png')
    browser.close()
```

The asyncio variant:

```py
import asyncio
from playwright import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        iphone_11 = p.devices['iPhone 11 Pro']
        browser = await p.webkit.launch(headless=False)
        context = await browser.newContext(
            **iphone_11,
            locale='en-US',
            geolocation={ 'longitude': 12.492507, 'latitude': 41.889938 },
            permissions=['geolocation']
        )
        page = await context.newPage()
        await page.goto('https://maps.google.com')
        await page.click('text="Your location"')
        await page.waitForRequest('*preview/pwa')
        await page.screenshot(path='colosseum-iphone.png')
        await browser.close()

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

#### Evaluate in browser context

This code snippet navigates to example.com in Firefox, and executes a script in the page context.

```py
from playwright import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.firefox.launch()
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto('https://www.example.com/')
    dimensions = page.evaluate('''() => {
      return {
        width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
        height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
        deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio
      }
    }''')
    print(dimensions)
    browser.close()
```

The asyncio variant:

```py
import asyncio
from playwright import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.firefox.launch()
        page = await browser.newPage()
        await page.goto('https://www.example.com/')
        dimensions = await page.evaluate('''() => {
          return {
            width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
            height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
            deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio
          }
        }''')
        print(dimensions)
        await browser.close()

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

#### Intercept network requests

This code snippet sets up request routing for a Chromium page to log all network requests.

```py
from playwright import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.newPage()

    def log_and_continue_request(route, request):
      print(request.url)
      route.continue_()

    # Log and continue all network requests
    page.route('**', lambda route, request: log_and_continue_request(route, request))

    page.goto('http://todomvc.com')
    browser.close()
```

The asyncio variant:

```py
import asyncio
from playwright import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch()
        page = await browser.newPage()

        def log_and_continue_request(route, request):
            print(request.url)
            asyncio.create_task(route.continue_())

        # Log and continue all network requests
        await page.route('**', lambda route, request: log_and_continue_request(route, request))

        await page.goto('http://todomvc.com')
        await browser.close()

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Is Playwright for Python ready?

We are ready for your feedback, but we are still covering Playwright Python with the tests, so expect some API changes and don't use for production.
